## Summary

Accurate wind power forecasts are important to implement wind energy into energy grids. This project looks into using a recurrent neural network (RNN) as well as a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict wind power based on numerical weather predictions and actual measurements of wind power in previous time periods. We found the RNN to perform best with accuracy between 79% and 86%, whereas the performance of the CNN was more volatile ranging from 61% to 83%.
